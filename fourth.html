        <p class="paragraph3">Hi my name is Kyreese Bailey and I'm the fastest man alive. I do things like save people and defeat aliens or save a civilian or two I might even saved you. But it wasn't always like that I used to just be Average fast I would get beat from time to time and then come back faster and faster,then  I started to run more on my free time and I would go before school with my dad to the park we would walk around 4 times and that was the equivalent of two miles although my dad was the only one really walking I would run past him many times and i would collapse every time after we were finished. To be exact he walked 4 laps I ran 8 laps so yeah we would alway meet at the same time me and my dad would both were all black clothes because it's harder to run or walk in black while its day because black absorbs heat which makes us more exhausted quicker but it didn't bother my dad as much because he didn't run at all. He would tell me it's not good to run in black because you could have a heat stroke. I didn't believe him so I just kept running then one day I ran as fast as I could and then I surpassed that I kept running and my arm started to move out of control than my whole body seemed to be going so fast that I couldn't even see it and then I started to see red flames coming from my body next thing I knew i was on fire then I started yelling help help help my dad didn't hear me at first but then he turned around and saw me burning up so then he threw a bucket of water on me but it didn't work so then I  was just screaming for help when I realised that the fire had faded away and I was back to normal everyone was shocked they couldn't believe what happened everyone was watching me they couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it myself .Me and my dad went home and he said to never tell mom so that was the end of it .I got home took a shower and chilled with my twin until i fell asleep. I woke up thinking about a dream I had last night it felt so real I had super speed and I saved a million people in a minute or two I got up and I had a headache it felt like I was getting smarter and smarter I felt my head for a fiever and I was burning up so then I had turned the fan on the highest level but the fan was going in slow motion I didn't know what was happening to me I it was seeming like everything in the world was behind me and I was in front of it then my mom came in the room and everything went back in normal speed she told me about the boy who saved a million people last night and how he had super speed and then I said oh my god out loud and my mom said what's wrong I said nothing and then I got my computer and there I was and I thought to myself this is awsomeeeee!</p>
